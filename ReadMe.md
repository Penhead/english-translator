English-English Translator is a single page app built using backbone on a static webpage. The data is pulled from an API I built (english-english-api.herokuapp.com).

The best way to use this app is to type a word into the search bar and hit the search button. The API is limited to words that would not be well-known across cultures, so words like "bloke" and "g'day" are not included, as I feel enough people would be able to understand that.

The app returns words from five different English-speaking countries, so that no matter where you are and no matter what word you search, you will receive the right response. It is up to the user to choose which word best clarifies their confusion.
