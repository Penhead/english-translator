      About the English Translator
    </h1>
    <p>
      This app was borne out of years of frustrating conversations as a transplant from Jamaica to the United States. After learning to code, I knew I wanted to build a tool that would help others in similar straits navigate the strange and unexpected conundrum of speaking English in an English-speaking country that is not your own. I hope this app helps each and every person who uses it. If you have any suggestions on how to make this app better, please send me an <a href="mailto:burgedenise@gmail.com">email</a>!
